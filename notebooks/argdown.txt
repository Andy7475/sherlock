  + <Argument 1>: Based on visual identification, Wally is at the library
  + <Argument 1>: The evidence strongly supports that Wally was in the library. His phone's GPS coordinates place him at the library location. Additionally, a librarian reports seeing someone matching Wally's description at the library. The combination of technical GPS data and an eyewitness account provides compelling evidence that Wally visited the library as the claim states.

  - <Argument 2>: While library records do not show Wally checking out any books today, which could suggest he did not visit the library, this evidence is quite weak on its own. It's possible to be at the library without checking out books. The bulk of the evidence, including GPS data and an eyewitness account, actually supports the claim that Wally was at the library. I did not find any compelling evidence to oppose this claim.
