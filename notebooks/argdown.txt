# Wally is in the library

[wally-is-in-the-library]: Wally is in the library (supporting=3 opposing=3)
  + <Argument 1>: There is compelling evidence supporting the claim that Wally is in the library. GPS data places Wally's phone at the library's coordinates, which strongly suggests his physical presence there. Additionally, a credible eyewitness account from Librarian Jane confirms that someone matching Wally's distinctive appearance was seen in the library at 3pm. Given Wally's recognizable fashion choice of always wearing a red and white striped top, Librarian Jane's identification is particularly reliable. While library card records don't show book checkouts, this doesn't contradict his presence as many library visitors use the facilities without borrowing materials - perhaps Wally is studying, using reference materials, or utilizing the library's computers or quiet space.
