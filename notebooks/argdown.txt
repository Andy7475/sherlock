# Wally is in the library

[wally-is-in-the-library]: Wally is in the library (supporting=2 opposing=1)

    + Wally's phone GPS shows he was at the library coordinates
    + Librarian Jane saw someone matching Wally's description at 3pm
  - <Argument 2>: While there is no definitive evidence proving Wally was not at the library, library records show he did not check out any books today. This suggests he may not have actually visited the library, or if he did, he didn't engage in typical library activities like borrowing books. However, this evidence is not conclusive, as Wally could have gone to the library without checking anything out.
    + Library card records don't show Wally checking out any books today
